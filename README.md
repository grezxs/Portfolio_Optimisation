Markowitz Portfolio Optimization â€“ Long-Only Implementation

This project presents an educational implementation of Markowitz's Modern Portfolio Theory using real market data. Developed in Python, it constructs a long-only optimal portfolio by balancing risk and return, and visualizes the efficient frontier to aid in understanding asset allocation strategies.

Key features include:
-Real market data integration via Yahoo Finance
-Covariance matrix estimation using historical returns
-Efficient frontier plotting for long-only portfolios
-Use of core Python libraries: pandas, numpy, scipy, and matplotlib
-Targeted toward finance professionals, academics, and recruiters, this Jupyter Notebook serves as both a practical demonstration and part of a broader portfolio of applied finance projects.
